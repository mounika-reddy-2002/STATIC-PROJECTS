# STATIC-PROJECTS
This contains simple Static Websites developed using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

A static website is a simplified form of a website that consists of fixed HTML, CSS, and occasionally JavaScript files, delivering content exactly as it's stored on the server without the need for server-side processing or databases. 
These websites are known for their speed, security, and cost-effectiveness, as they load quickly, are less susceptible to security vulnerabilities, and are easy to host and maintain. 
While static websites are ideal for content-centric pages like blogs, portfolios, and informational sites, they may lack dynamic features and require manual updates to change content, making them less suitable for highly interactive or frequently updated web applications.
